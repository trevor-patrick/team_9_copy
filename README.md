## Welcome to team 9's project! We worked hard to bring Catalyst a product foundation.

# We present an authenticated webapp providing multiple dashboards

	- Allows for careful saving

# To realize our vision, we used the following tech stack
- Python
	- Flask
- MySQL
- HTML, CSS, Javascript
- Text-to-Speach (HTML5)
- 

# Our biggest learning experiences
- Configuring interaction between frontend and middleware
- Keeping database tables consistant
- Properly routing between views
- git

# Challenges:
- determining which features were worth implementing
- browser cache! our webapp was running off files we intentionally deleted
